# API_Mini-Project
This was done as a part of Springboard Data Science Career Track course (Unit5.4.3. API Mini-Project).

This exercise dealed with the stock price data of Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, medical lasers for laser eye surgery, from Qunadl API. I prcticed pulling data from API and data wrangling to a JSON file.
